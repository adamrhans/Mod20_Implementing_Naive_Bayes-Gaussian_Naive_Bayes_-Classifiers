In this assignment, you will implement Naïve Bayes and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifiers using the Python Scikit-learn library. In the first part of the assignment, you will be working with a sample dataset to implement a simple Naïve Bayes classifier that classifies the data into binary values.

In the second part of the assignment, you will extend your Naïve Bayes classifier to make predictions on more than two labels using the Wine dataset from the Scikit-learn library.

Finally, in the third part of the assignment, you will work with a dataset that contains normal (ham) and spam SMS messages. For this last exercise, you will use a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether a message is normal (ham) or spam.
