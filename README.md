# Project: Implementing Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifiers

### Overview
I will implement Naïve Bayes and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifiers using the Python Scikit-learn library. In the first part of the assignment, you will be working with a sample dataset to implement a simple Naïve Bayes classifier that classifies the data into binary values.

In the second part, I will extend my Naïve Bayes classifier to make predictions on more than two labels using the Wine dataset from the Scikit-learn library.

Finally, in the third part, I will work with a dataset that contains normal (ham) and spam SMS messages. For this last exercise, I will use a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether a message is normal (ham) or spam.

### Data Engineering Concepts
- Utilize the Python Scikit-Learn Library to implement Naive Bayes and Naive Gaussian Bayes classifiers
- Implement spam detection using Python
